### Changelog
- Better but still non-intrusive style
- Saved un/collapsed states
- Option for grouping your groups, default is off because I like to keep my system: entries visually apart
- A lot changed while I was trying to fix a small visual bug with a hammer...

### Planned
- General fixes to errors I can spot and fix
- Might also give a new folder-like system to the drop down since I want to sort character/world/chat/prompts interdependently
- Learning how to make this from scratch instead of gutting and reverse engineering
